# oxid

This puppet module setups an oxid shop including mysql server, apache and php.

## Features
	- MySQL Server installation/setup
	- PHP installation/setup
	- Apache installation/setup
	- Zend Guard installation/setup
		For the oxid PE/EE Editions special classes, like oxid::php::zendguardloader to setup Zend Guard, are included.
	- Repository stuff, to handle sources from local or remote locations in a same way. 
	- Remote stuff, to download oxid data and sql dump.
	- Oxid Shop installation/setup. 
		Supported Versions: 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 5.0, 5.1 and also legacy version 4.4.8
	- Oxid Theme installation/setup
	- Oxid Module installation/setup
	- Common configuration of oxconfig and oxshop
	- File checks, see http://wiki.oxidforge.org/Installation#Files_.26_Folder_Permission_Setup for details.
	- View Updates for oxid EE, to work correctly.
	- Oxid Shop unattended update/upgrade
		This was the primary reason for developing this module, to get the possibility to update from oxid EE 4.4.8 to 5.1.1.

## Repositories
Several repositories locations can be configured to get third-party archives.
At the moment local and wget repositories types are supported.
E.g. use class oxid with parameter repository and source(only basename) to get required archive.
For your environment you can download the oxid archives by your self and provide them via a local file directory, a http server or a puppet master setup in conjunction with a 'puppet://something' URI.
  
### oxid::repository::config::file
```puppet
	oxid::repository::config::file{ 'oxidee': root => ''}
```	
	Configure a local repository named 'oxidee' to the root directory.
	 
### oxid::repository::config::wget
```puppet
	oxid::repository::config::wget { 'oxid':
  		directory  => undef,
  		url		   => "http://example.com/oxid",
  		user       => undef,
  		password   => undef,
  		timeout    => 900,
  		verbose    => false,
  		redownload => false
  	}
```  	
  	Configure a remote repository named 'oxid' to the root URL http://example.com/oxid.  	
  	 
## Mysql
Installs and setups a mysql server. This is optional, you can use a remote or install a custom MySQL sever instance.
A password is required. If you do not specify any override_options, the default override options will be calculated, see class oxid::mysql::server::params.
The example shows you a configuration with 2GB system memory. For more information see https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/mysql.

```puppet
 class {
    'oxid::mysql::server::install': 
    password => "secret",
    override_options => {
	    'mysqld' => {
	      'max_connections'   => 100,
	      'table_cache'       => 12800,
	      'key_buffer'        => "256M",
	      'join_buffer_size'  => "8M",
	      'query_cache_size'  => "64M",
	      'query_cache_limit' => "64M"
	    }
	 }  
  }
```
  
## Apache
Installs and setups an Apache server instance. This is optional, you can use a custom Apache sever instance/setup.
For more information see https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apache.
 
```puppet
	oxid::apache::install { "apache":
	  docroot           => "/srv/www/oxid",

```

### Zend Guard
The class oxid::php::zendguardloader will add Zend Guard to the apache php module.
This class is configured with the zend repository by default.

## Oxid Setup
The class oxid setups a oxid shop. Requires an Apache instance, a PHP installation and a MySQL server instance to work.

```puppet 
oxid { "oxid":
  source			  => { "index.php" => "OXID_ESHOP_CE_CURRENT.zip"},
  repository          => "oxidce",
  purge               => true,
  shop_dir            => "/srv/www/oxid",
  compile_dir         => "/srv/www/oxid/tmp",
  db_type             => "mysql",
  db_host             => "localhost",
  db_name             => "oxid",
  db_user             => "oxid"
  db_password         => "oxid",
  shop_url            => "http://myhostname",
  shop_ssl_url        => "https://myhostname",
  admin_ssl_url       => "https://myhostname/admin",
  utf8_mode           => 0,
  rewrite_base        => "/",
  config_content      => undef,
  htaccess_content    => undef,
  config_source       => undef,
  htaccess_source     => undef,
  config_extra_replacements   => {},
  htaccess_extra_replacements => {},
  db_setup_sql        => ["setup/sql/database.sql"],
  owner               => "www-data",
  group               => "www-data"
}
```

### Setup Configuration
The file config.inc.php and .htaccess file will be configure, by token replacements in conjunction with the defined parameters or directly by source contents.
 
### Parameters
	- repository					The repository to get from
	- source						The location of the setup archive in the defined repository. For output mapping use a hash, like { "index.php" => "OXID_ESHOP_CE_CURRENT.zip"}. This will download index.php to download file OXID_ESHOP_CE_CURRENT.zip. Helpfully to download from oxid default location.
	- purge							If true, deletes the shop dir.
	- shop_dir						The oxid shop directroy
	- compile_dir					The oxid compile directroy
	- db_type						Default is mysql and is only supported type.
	- db_host						Oxid database host
	- db_name						Oxid database name
	- db_user						Oxid database user
	- db_password					Oxid database password
	- shop_url						Oxid shop url
	- shop_ssl_url					Oxid shop ssl url
	- admin_ssl_url					Oxid admin ssl url
	- rewrite_base					Rewrite Base in the .htaccess file
	- config_content				Your own oxyid configuration content
	- htaccess_content				Your own htaccess configuration content	
	- config_source					Your own oxid configuration source
	- htaccess_source				Your own oxid htaccess source
	- config_extra_replacements		Extra replacements for oxid configuration. Example: {"\$this->sTheme[ ]*=[ ]*.*;" => "\$this->sTheme = 'basic';" }
	- htaccess_extra_replacements	Extra replacements for htaccess
	- db_setup_sqls					The setup file to execute. Default is ["setup/sql/database.sql"]. Use ["setup/sql/database.sql", "setup/sql/demodata.sql"] to install also demodata. Ordering will be recordnized.
	- owner							The owner of the directories
	- group							The group of the directories
	  
### File check
A file check is done by default, to change owner, group and permissions of each file or directory.
Removes also setup and updateApp directoryies. The compile directory will be purged.
See http://wiki.oxidforge.org/Installation#Files_.26_Folder_Permission_Setup for details.

### Update views
An update view command will be done by default to create all necessary Views in the database.
This is needed for e.g. Oxid Enterprise Edition to work correctly.
    
## Remote Utils
Some helpfull utils to handle with existing shops.

### oxid::sshFetchRemoteData
Fetch via ssh/rsync shop data files.
The backup directory allows you to use the archive files without downloading them twice.
Use purge => true to purge the backuped file.
Allowed compression for the archive: gzip, bzip2 and none.

This define will recordnize the ordering the oxid class executions.

```puppet 
oxid::sshFetchRemoteData { "root@myhostname":
  shop_dir 					=> "/srv/www/oxid",
  remote_dir				=> "/srv/www/oxid",
  includes    				=> ["out/pictures", "out/media", "out/downloads"]
}
```
  
### oxid::sshFetchRemoteSQL
Fetch via ssh shop sql data and import them to the MySQL Database. 
The backup directory allows you to use the archive files without downloading them twice.
Use purge => true to purge archive file.
Allowed compression for the archive: gzip, bzip2 and none.

Use dump_tables => [] download all tables and views. This example use an advance statement to collect all table names excluding oxadminlog and all views.
In the oxid Enterprise Edition, Views shoul be excluded in the dump. Otherwise you run in some problems.
 
I have prepare two dump_options: $oxid::params::default_remote_dump_options_utf8 and $oxid::params::default_remote_dump_options_latin1.
This allows you creating mysql dumps for utf8 and latin1 charsets.
  
This define will recordnize the ordering the oxid class executions.
  
```puppet 
oxid::sshFetchRemoteSQL { "root@myhostname":
  db_name            => "oxid",
  db_user            => "oxid",
  db_password        => "oxid"
  db_host            => "localhost",
  db_port            => 3306,
  remote_db_name     => "oxid",
  remote_db_user     => "oxid",
  remote_db_password => "oxid",
  remote_db_host     => "localhost",
  remote_db_port     => 3306,
  dump_tables 		 => "$(mysql --user='${configurations['remoteDBUser']}' --password='${configurations['remoteDBPwd']}' -B -N -e \"Select TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = '\\''${configurations['remoteDBName']}'\\'' AND TABLE_TYPE != '\\''VIEW'\\'' AND TABLE_NAME NOT IN('\\''oxadminlog'\\'')\" | grep -v Tables_in | xargs)",
  dump_options       = $oxid::params::default_remote_dump_options_utf8
}
```
## Oxid Updates
Updates an existing oxid shop.
Oxid offers update/upgrade packages. These packages have to unpack and some archive directories have to copy to shop directory.
A script have to be executed to run the update process. The update process can not complete without user actions.  
This module offer a solution to complete the update process without user actions. A new unattended run_cli.php script custom UI class defintion will be used, to answer the questions in the update process.
Also you can only run the sql files for update. This is usefully, because sometimes the update process in cli mode does not execute correctly the sql files.
This will also update the config.inc.php and .htaccess file, make a file check and make a view update, if set.

```puppet
oxid::update { "oxid448To465"
  source			  => "UPDATE_OXID_ESHOP_EE_V.4.4.8_34028_TO_V.4.6.5_49955_for_PHP5.3.zip",

## Simple Oxid CE Setup Example
This install all needed components for a single server with current oxid ce version and with no UTF8 mode.
If you don't want the demo data, please remove extra_db_setup_sqls parameter from class oxid.

```puppet
  oxid::repository::config::wget{"oxidce": url => "http://download.oxid-esales.com/ce"}
  
  class {
    'oxid::mysql::server::install': 
    password => "oxid"
  }

Change config.vm.box, config.vm.hostname, config.vm.box_url and so on for your requirements.
Run vagrant up in your vagrant folder to starting up VM. If no provision was made, run vagrant provision to do this, or use vagrant up --provision.

##### Boxes
I have tested agains the precise64 box from vagrant http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box.

Use vagrant box add precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box to install requiered box.

I run into several problems, with the installed vagrant ruby version and augeas.
I resolve the problems by upgrading to ruby 1.9.
I provide a shell that do the job for me. See shell for details.

##### shell
Vagrant runs a shell provisoning (examples/shell/main.sh), to install some requirements:
	- ruby 1.9						augeas problem
	- open3_backport >= 0.0.3		augeas problem
	- puppet >= 3.4.2				current puppet version
	- facter >= 1.7.4				current facter version
	- librarian-puppet-maestrodev	current librarian-puppet-maestrodev to install puppet modules
	- installs current puppet-oxid module from git, including dependencies.	See main.sh for other options.

You can use this script to prepare you own boxes.
If no more needed, comment out config.vm.provision :shell in Vagrant file.

### Current CE
	Installs a current Oxid CE Shop. Binary sources will be loaded from http://download.oxid-esales.com/ce
	Change Vagrant puppet.manifests_path to "../puppet/current_ce/manifest"
	
	Actions:
	- Install MySQL Server
	- Install PHP
	- Install Zend Guard
	- Install Apache
	- Install current oxid CE Shop
	- Set some values in the oxshops table.
		
### Upgrade Oxid EE 4.4.8 to 5.1.1
	Installs a Oxid Shop EE 4.4.8 with sql dump, piciture and media data from a remote host.
	Preapare your own download location for the oxid binaries. See Actions, which binaryies aou have to to provide.
	Change init.pp, if you don#t want a wget repositoy. 
	
	Change Vagrant puppet.manifests_path to "../puppet/upgradeEE448To5.1.x/manifest"
	Change Vagrant config.vm.synced_folder to e.g. "../../../mydata", "/vagrant_data"
	
	Add/Change YAML oxid-config.yml file for your requirements in config.vm.synced_folder. Under examples/puppet/upgradeEE448To5.1.x/yaml you find an example.
	Attention: Because of using a remote oxid instance, used this script with your own risk! Try to use mysql user with only read access.
	Add keyfile to config.vm.synced_folder
		
	Actions:
	- Install MySQL Server
	- Install PHP
	- Install Zend Guard
	- Install Apache
	- Install 4.4.8 with source OXID_ESHOP_EE_4.4.8_34028_for_PHP5.3.zip
	- Fetches picture and media data from remote host
	- Fetches sql dump from remote host
	- Upgrade from 4.4.8 to 4.6.5 with source UPDATE_OXID_ESHOP_EE_V.4.4.8_34028_TO_V.4.6.5_49955_for_PHP5.3.zip
	- Upgrade from 4.6.5 to 5.0.0 with source UPGRADE_OXID_ESHOP_EE_V.4.6.5_49955_TO_V.5.0.0_51243.zip. Some files may be upgraded by you, see init.pp class oxid448To465 for more details.
	- Upgrade from 5.0.0 to 5.1.4 with source UPDATE_OXID_ESHOP_EE_V.5.0.0_TO_V.5.1.4_for_PHP_5.3.zip
	- Activate azure theme	

## Requirements
	- maestrodev/wget 1.3.1
	- camptocamp/augeas 0.0.1
	- puppetlabs/stdlib 4.1.0
	- puppetlabs/apt 1.4.0
	- puppetlabs/concat 1.0.0
	- puppetlabs/mysql 2.1.0
	- nodes/php 0.7.0
	- puppetlabs/apache 0.10.0
	- puppetlabs/concat 1.0.0
	
## Limitations
	This has been tested on Ubuntu Precise and Debian Wheezy.
	Debian Wheezy, CentOS 5.8, and FreeBSD 9.1 should work, because of the used dependencies.
	PHP version changes e.g from 5.3 to 5.4 may causes problems in Oxid EE Editions, because of the Zend Loader. When setup/upgrade in one big step, stay in one PHP version.
	Also downgrading from PHP 5.4 to 5.3 may be an option e.g. for an big upgrade from Oxid EE 4.4.8 to current versions, but this is another story.
	
## Todo
	- Setting license information in PE/EE versions
	- unattended utf8 update
	- more testing
